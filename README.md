# PHP Utilities

PHP utilities accessible by Composer. Tested with PHP version 5.4.

*Registry* is a singleton implementing *ArrayAccess* and object access with **LIFO**, Last-In-First-Out behavior.

*DateTime* and *Date* add convenience methods to the built-in PHP *DateTime* class. This includes the __toString method that returns a date-time string formatted for the default MySQL date-time format.

##Composer
```
> composer require diskerror/utilities
```
